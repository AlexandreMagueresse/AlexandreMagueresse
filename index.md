I am a PhD student in Computational Mathematics at Monash University.

I am working under the supervision of Prof. Santiago Badia on the minimisation of energy residuals in nonlinear approximation spaces. I am focusing on 
* The design of nonlinear approximation spaces (neural networks, adaptive Finite Elements, sparse grids),
* The minimisation of energy functionals coming from elliptic partial differential equations in such spaces,
* The analysis of the stability and convergence of these schemes.
