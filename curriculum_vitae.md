### Projects
* Reconstruction of the score of a piano recording. Design of a strategy to separate note groups (temporal and amplitude conditions); Temporal filtering with various windows; Fourier analysis of a sound recording followed by harmonic analysis to identify the notes played; Reconstruction of the score.
* Graphic interface and artificial intelligence for the *Penguins* game. The *Penguins* game is a board game for 2 to 4 players, where the objective is to recover as many points as possible by eating fish on a 60-square board. Each move removes one square, so you have to reconcile mobility with the lure of winning. Development of a digital version of the game; Implementation of several artificial intelligences at different levels, based on tree exploration principles: minimax, maxn algorithm, alpha-beta pruning, Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) guided by a random forest, heuristics specific to the Penguins game. Six-person teamwork, Python, Pygame, GitHub.
* Artificial interpretation of natural languages. Design and implementation of an automatic summarisation algorithm from English corpora (Python); Synthesis of the English grammar (according to Chomsky's formalism) in order to implement an English parser for a hierarchical combination of word vectors into a sentence vector.
* Automatic image colouring. Coloured black and white image based on context and user-specified cues. Modification of an existing algorithm by Zhang & al. (Real-Time User-Guided Image Colorization with Learned Deep Priors, 2017): instead of prescribing colours at points, the user prescribes colours on lines; Improved the signal to noise ratio and produced more realistic images.
* [Study of the automatic processing of natural languages applied to low-resource languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07264). Constitution and review of the state of the art by subtask (parts of speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entities recognition, tagging and linking, speech recognition, translation, classification, embedding) of NLP methods used in the context of low-resource languages; Proposals for new resources and research directions.
