## Personal information
* **Full name**: Alexandre Magueresse
* **Nationality**: French
* **Institutional e-mail**: alexandre.magueresse@monash.edu

## Degrees
* **Sep. 2015 - Jul. 2017, Lycée Chateaubriand (Rennes, France).** *Classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles (CPGE), MPSI - MP\*.* Two-year intensive program to prepare for the entrance exam to French engineering schools. 

    **Relevant courses**: Mathematics; Physics; Chemistry; Computer science (Python, OCaml); Engineering.

    **Projects**:
    * Reconstruction of the score of a piano recording. Design of a strategy to separate note groups (temporal and amplitude conditions); Temporal filtering with various windows; Fourier analysis of a sound recording followed by harmonic analysis to identify the notes played; Reconstruction of the score.

* **Sep. 2017 - Jul. 2021, École Centrale de Lyon (Lyon, France).** *Master of Engineering.* GAP: 3.9, Ranking : 10/400.

    **Relevant courses**: Numerical analysis; Finite Element Method; Algorithm design; Data structures; Collaborative algorithms; Natural language processing; Image processing; Signal processing; Continuum mechanics; Fluid mechanics.

    **Projects**:
    * Graphic interface and artificial intelligence for the *Penguins* game. The *Penguins* game is a board game for 2 to 4 players, where the objective is to recover as many points as possible by eating fish on a 60-square board. Each move removes one square, so you have to reconcile mobility with the lure of winning. Development of a digital version of the game; Implementation of several artificial intelligences at different levels, based on tree exploration principles: minimax, maxn algorithm, alpha-beta pruning, Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) guided by a random forest, heuristics specific to the Penguins game. Six-person teamwork, Python, Pygame, GitHub.
    * Artificial interpretation of natural languages. Design and implementation of an automatic summarisation algorithm from English corpora (Python); Synthesis of the English grammar (according to Chomsky's formalism) in order to implement an English parser for a hierarchical combination of word vectors into a sentence vector.

* **Aug. 2019 - Jul. 2021, Tsinghua University (Beijing, China).** *Master in Advanced Computing, specialisation in Artificial intelligence.* GPA : 4.0, Ranking : 1/141.

    **Master thesis**: DepBERT: Towards a Grammatical Dependency Enhanced BERT. **Advisor**: Prof. Maosong Sun. Addition of a new training task for the BERT model to enrich its linguistic knowledge; Modified BERT's masking strategy to give more weight to words involved in subject-verb or verb-object relationships, particularly when the two words are far apart; Use of the Penn Tree Bank database, and creation of a new database using an automatic parser on the Wikipedia corpus; Improved ability to reproduce a syntax tree by 1% (8.3% error reduction) while maintaining accuracy on the GLUE benchmark.

    **Relevant courses** Computational linguistics; Natural Language Processing; Combinatorics and algorithm design; Time series analysis; Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Web Information Retrieval; Introduction to Big Data systems.

    **Projects**: 
    * Automatic image colouring. Coloured black and white image based on context and user-specified cues. Modification of an existing algorithm by Zhang & al. (Real-Time User-Guided Image Colorization with Learned Deep Priors, 2017): instead of prescribing colours at points, the user prescribes colours on lines; Improved the signal to noise ratio and produced more realistic images.
    * [Study of the automatic processing of natural languages applied to low-resource languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07264). Constitution and review of the state of the art by subtask (parts of speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entities recognition, tagging and linking, speech recognition, translation, classification, embedding) of NLP methods used in the context of low-resource languages; Proposals for new resources and research directions.
    
* **Feb. 2022 - Aug. 2025, Monash University (Melbourne, Australia).** *PhD in Mathematics.*

    **PhD thesis**: ... **Advisors**: Prof. Santiago Badia, Prof. Tiangang Cui, Jai Tushar.
